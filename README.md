## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will now be available for you to view in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

### Building for Production

To create an optimized build of the application for deployment:

```sh
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder in the project root containing all the static files needed for deployment.
